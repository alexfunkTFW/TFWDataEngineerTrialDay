# TFWDataEngineerTrialDay
Some sample scripts to provide infrastructure for a remote trial day as part of the recruitment process 
of the TFW Data-Team. Prior to the training day candidates should use this material to set up a local 
instance of apache airflow 2.0 by building a custom docker image with the provided docker file and 
using this inside the docker compose setup specified by the given docker-compose file.

On this basis, we will provide some task(s) depending on candidate profile during the actual training day. 
These tasks are supposed to be worked on at that day by candidates in collaboration (please ask questions) 
with other team members.
